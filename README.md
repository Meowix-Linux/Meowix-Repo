## Installation
The Meowix repositories *should* already be included by default in Meowix Linux. ~~If installing this on another Arch-based distro, however, simply add these lines to /etc/pacman.conf:~~ *The Meowix Linux Package Repository is currently not available; we need to add the first packages to the repo. Give us, at most, a day or two.*
